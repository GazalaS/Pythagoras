Server Client application in java hibernate jersey jquery mysql

## Assignment Details
> A server-application in Java that should contain:
    A relational database with two tables (we use MySQL (https://www.mysql.com/)).
        Table 1: Building, should contain id and name of buildings.
        Table 2: Floor, should contain id, name and area of floors. Each floor should have a relation to a building. 
    A web service (we use Jersey (https://jersey.github.io/) to write web services) that sends information about the floors in json-format.
    The information in the database should be fetched using Hibernate (http://hibernate.org/orm/).

>A client-application that should contain: 
     An HTML-page that asks for the floors using the web service created in the server application.
     The result should be an html table like the example below:

 Name | Area | Building name 
------------ | ------------ | ------------ 
FloorA1 | 2500 | BuildingA
FloorA2 | 4000 | BuildingA
FloorB1 | 1500 | BuildingB
FloorB2 | 500 | BuildingB
FloorB3 | 400 | BuildingB
 | 8900 | 

 The request from the client to the server, and the html table, should be done and created using jQuery (https://jquery.com/).
